# AutoGen Projects Directory

This directory (`autogen_pruebas/`) is dedicated to projects, experiments, and prototypes built using Microsoft's AutoGen framework and related agent-based technologies.

## What to Expect
- **Multiple AutoGen Projects**: Each subfolder or script may represent a different experiment, demo, or advanced use case.
- **Continuous Expansion**: More AutoGen-based tools, QA systems, and agent workflows will be added over time.
- **Documentation**: Each project will include its own README with setup and usage instructions.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or suggest new AutoGen experiments!
